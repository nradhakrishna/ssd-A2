## ❓ **Troubleshooting**

### **"Ball won't move when I move mouse"**
✅ **Solution**: 
- Make sure your mouse is **OVER the 3D game area** (black area with the lane)
- Try moving mouse more dramatically left-to-right
- Ball has increased range now (moves ±80% across lane)

### **"Power bar doesn't appear"**
✅ **Solution**:
- Click **INSIDE the game canvas** (the 3D area, not the scoreboard)
- Hold the click for at least 0.5 seconds
- Make sure you haven't already thrown the ball

### **"Nothing happens when I click"**
✅ **Solution**:
- Check you're clicking on the **left side** (3D game area), not scoreboard
- Make sure current frame isn't complete
- Try the **"Throw Ball" button** instead

### **"Ball moves too fast/slow"**
✅ **Solution**:
- Hold click **longer** for more power (max 2 seconds)
- Hold click **shorter** for less power
- Or use "Throw Ball" button for consistent medium power

## 🎮 **Pro Tips**

1. **Center Shots**: Keep mouse in middle = straight shot
2. **Left Shots**: Move mouse left = ball starts on left
3. **Right Shots**: Move mouse right = ball starts on right
4. **Power Control**:
   - Quick click (0.5s) = ~25% power
   - Medium hold (1s) = ~50% power
   - Long hold (2s) = 100% power
5. **Watch the Ball**: The red ball position shows your aim before throwing
