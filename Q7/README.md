- **3 games total** with average calculation
- **Foul line enforcement** (simulated)

### ðŸŽ¯ Controls

#### Mouse Controls
- **Drag Mouse Left/Right**: Aim ball direction
- **Click & Hold**: Build power (longer hold = more power)
- **Release**: Throw ball

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Space**: Reset camera view
- **R**: Start new game

#### Buttons

## How to Play

### 1. Select Game Mode
Choose from the dropdown menu:
- Traditional Singles
- Unified Doubles
- Unified Team (4 Players)

### 2. Aim Your Shot
- Move your mouse left/right to aim
- The ball will move to show your aim direction
- Ball position indicates where it will start

### 3. Set Power
- Click and hold to build power
- Power meter increases with hold time
- Release to throw with that power level

### 4. Watch the Results
- Ball rolls down lane with realistic physics
- Pins knocked down are counted automatically
- Strike/Spare messages appear for special scores

### 5. Continue Playing
- Play through all 10 frames
- In multi-player modes, switch between players
- Complete 3 games for final average

## Scoring Examples

### Strike
```
Frame 1: X (all 10 pins first ball)
Frame 2: 7, 2 (7 pins, then 2 pins)
Frame 1 Score: 10 + 7 + 2 = 19
Frame 2 Score: 19 + 7 + 2 = 28
```

### Spare
```
Frame 1: 7, / (7 pins, then 3 pins)
Frame 2: 5, 3 (5 pins, then 3 pins)
Frame 1 Score: 10 + 5 = 15
Frame 2 Score: 15 + 5 + 3 = 23
```

### Open Frame
```
Frame 1: 7, 2 (7 pins, then 2 pins)
Frame 1 Score: 7 + 2 = 9
```

### Perfect Game (300)
```
12 strikes in a row (10 frames + 2 bonus in 10th)
X X X X X X X X X X X X
Score: 300
```

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Three.js r128**: 3D graphics rendering
- **Cannon.js 0.6.2**: Physics simulation
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Rendering target
- **CSS3**: Modern UI styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic

### Physics Implementation
- **Gravity**: -20 m/sÂ² for realistic ball motion
- **Ball mass**: 7 kg (standard bowling ball)
- **Pin mass**: 1.5 kg (standard bowling pin)
- **Friction**: 0.3 for lane surface
- **Restitution**: 0.5 for bouncing
- **Collision detection**: Precise AABB and sphere collisions

### 3D Scene Components
1. **Bowling Lane**: 20 units long, wood texture
2. **Side Walls**: Prevent ball from going off lane
3. **10 Pins**: Cylindrical geometry in triangular formation
4. **Ball**: Spherical geometry with metallic material
5. **Lighting**: Ambient + directional + point lights
6. **Camera**: Perspective view from behind ball

### Game Logic Classes
- `BowlingGame`: Main game controller
- `Player`: Manages individual player state and scoring
- `Frame`: Represents a single frame with throws and score

## Official Rules Reference

### Lane Etiquette
- Bowl on your own lane
- Wait for adjacent lanes to finish
- Don't cross foul line (enforced in-game)
- Wear appropriate attire (visual theme applied)

### Scoring Validation
- Automatic calculation of strikes and spares
- Correct bonus ball handling
- Accurate 10th frame special rules
- Proper score accumulation across frames

### Game Modes Compliance
All three Special Olympics of Oklahoma (SOOK) bowling events are implemented:
1. âœ… Traditional Singles Bowling
2. âœ… Unified Doubles Bowling
3. âœ… Unified Team Bowling

## Tips for High Scores

1. **Aim for the Pocket**: Target between pin 1 and 3 (or 1 and 2)
2. **Consistent Power**: Use similar power levels for predictability
3. **Watch the Angle**: Small angle changes affect pin action greatly
4. **Practice Spares**: Converting spares is key to high scores
5. **Stay Behind Foul Line**: Foul line violations result in 0 pins

## Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome 90+ (recommended)
- âœ… Firefox 88+
- âœ… Safari 14+
- âœ… Edge 90+

**Note**: WebGL support required. Enable hardware acceleration for best performance.
